        <p>These shoes are not comfortable! I tried to run in them and almost fell. The shoes are to blame.
            I believe I also now have runner's knee pain. I will check with my physician and come back to update
            this review. I will probably have to sue the company for this terrible inconvenience. I do not reccommend at
            all! If I could give a negative star instead of zero, I would!
